## XML_File_Check

### Description

When put in a folder with XML-Files and run, xml_check.py will check all present XML-files for unclosed and unopened XML-tags and return a list of
closing tags that follow closing tags or opening tags that follow opening tags with the corresponding line in a file, which is saved in the subfolder 
"XML Tag Logs".

Future updates will aim to make this script more robust.
